A useless website.

This website provides a way to waste your time.
It features a canvas where hundred, thousand and more, "LOL" are drawn in a great ambiance :)

More seriously, this project allow me to discover the HTML5 canvas basis.
It also provides a complete functional fallback for older browser (IE8 and below, I see you).
This fallback is based on DOM elements and is obviously slower than canvas.
